# ResPeer: Peer-to-Peer content publishing application on Linera

## TL;DR

ResPeer is a Peer-to-Peer content publishing application on Linera. It facilitates a creator ecosystem which participants can earn Linera native token (if any) and credits by creating contents, selling art works, reviewing or joining in activities.

## Introduction

Linera is new generation L1 blockchain which supports horizontal scaling by the concept called *microchain*. Validators in Linera could adjust their workers based on network demand, thus it could bring web2 level QoS to web3 industry. ResPeer is the first real time social feed application on Linera. ResPeer aims to build a creators' community in which creators could monitize their work fairly in web3 world. Tranditional monolithic chain packs transactions into blocks, then the blocks will be confirmed by validators to reach consensus. Due to all participants of the network compete for limited block space, some transactions have to wait for long time to be processed.  Running a social feed application needs different resources: storage space for persistent messages, real time notification for new contents, scalability for burst access, etc. We have to leverage a lot of work to centralized servers, or integrate different chains for the metioned requirements. In Linera, we can do these all in one blockchain. We can persisten messages, contents and images to blob storage which works as a Content Addressable Network, stored contents will be replicated in Linera network automatically. We can implement real time notification with native data stream. Most importantly, the message won't wait in mempool any more, it could reach its target quickly. All of those are the basement to implement a web2 level web3 social feed application.
